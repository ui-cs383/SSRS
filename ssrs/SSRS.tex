\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\textit{Freedom in the Star System} will consist of three parts: a visual client that a human user will use to play an instance of a game, an AI that will serve as a non-human player and a server that will contain all of the game logic and state.  The server is further broken down into three subsystems: a system that handles game logic and rules, a database that will hold the current status of all games being played and a network interface that the visual client and AI will connect to in order to communicate with the backend.

\subsection{Product Functions}
Using the visual client (herein referred to as the GUI or the client), a user will be able to view a list of games and their options that are waiting for a second player to join in order to start.  A user will also be able to join one of these listed games in order to play a game against an opponent.  A user will be able to create a new game by selecting from a short list of preferences and joining the matchmaking queue.  Finally, a user will be able to create a new game against an AI (computer) opponent.  The server (also referred to as the backend) will be able to accept requests from either a human or non-human (AI) player and determine whether the received request is a valid request or not.  The server will then respond to the requesting user the results of their request and update any changes to the game state that a request may have affected.  The AI will act as a non-human player (or client in the network sense) that will attempt to send requests to the server, based on a specific strategy in order to attempt to win the game or prevent the opposing player from winning.

\subsection{User Characteristics}
There are primarily two different types of users that will use this system.  One user, the general player, is only interested in playing a game (also referred to as a match) with another player.  This type of user will try to avoid anything that relates to operating the server; the one exception to this being the user starting the server application in order to start the game logic engine.  The second, and less common user, is the user interested in running an instance of the server application for other users to connect to, essentially as a central host for other players to connect to.

\subsection{Constraints}
\textit{Freedom in the Star System} has very few constraints.  In order for two users to play a game together, the two computers must be connected to a common network.  This network can be a LAN, however most commonly this will be the Internet.  If a loss of the network connection occurs, the user will be able to restart their client and reconnect to their game.  If a loss of network connection happens where the server application resides, the server application will need to be re-executed - it will then retrieve its game state from the database and wait for new requests to be sent from the clients.  A user may use their computer's internal network to play a game against an AI opponent in which case a network connection loss won't create any issues (as long as the server application is being executed locally).  The only other constraints the \textit{Freedom in the Star System} application imposes is that it meets certain minimum system specifications as required by the 3rd party tools in use.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\textit{Freedom in the Star System} will operate under Linux, Mac OSX and Microsoft Windows.  All of the third party resources that are in use have support for these three operation systems as well.  \textit{Freedom in the Star System} depends on the following third party tools:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Python 2.7.5 or higher
		\item The following Python Libraries
		\begin{itemize}
			\item PyGame
			\item RPyC
			\item SQLAlchemy
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

Earlier or later versions of the Python programming language may in fact work, but there is no guarantee that this is the case and Python 2.7.5 is the only officially supported version of Python.  All of the libraries that \textit{Freedom in the Star System} requires are supported by Python 2.7.5 at a minimum.

\subsection{System Level (Non-Functional) Requirements}
This subsection identifies system-level requirements that may impact the construction, operation, packaging and delivery of the system and software.

\subsubsection{Site Dependencies}
\textit{Freedom in the Star System} requires the following in order to run:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Operating Systems
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Linux 2.6 and above
		\item Mac OSX 10.7 and above
		\item Microsoft Windows XP and above
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Python 2.7.5
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item PyGame
		\item RPyC
		\item SQLAlchemy
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Broadband connection for Internet games
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Safety, Security and Privacy Requirements}
There are no inherent safety, security or privacy requirements of this application.  As a precaution however, all users of the system should keep private those things that they would not want revealed in public; the user may be playing against another player and there is no way to control what that opponent may say and/or do given any private information.

\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}
%{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
%This paragraph should specify both the static and the dynamic numerical
%performance requirements placed on the soft ware or on human
%interaction as a whole. \ Static numerical requirements may include the
%following: a) The number of terminals to be supported; b) The number of
%simultaneous users to be supported; c) Amount and type of information
%to be handled. \ Dynamic numerical requirements may include, for
%example, the numbers of transactions and tasks and the amount of data
%to be processed within certain time periods for both normal and peak
%workload conditions. \ All of these requirements should be stated in
%measurable terms. For example, {\textquotedblleft}95\% of the
%transactions shall be processed in less than
%1msec.{\textquotedblright}}

The AI must be able to make decisions in under 90 seconds for any given hardware platform; after 90 seconds, if the best decision hasn't been found, then the best decision that has been found thus far should be selected in order to move on.

The Backend must be able to make most logic computations in under one second and not exceed three seconds in handling an entire request, from calculating the result to preparing and submitting the response.  The Backend has no control over network transfer speeds, so the actual time for a client to receive a response may be higher.

The Backend has no overall memory or hard disk space requirements because a single instance of the server could be hosting a large number of simultaneous games.  It is the responsibility of the server administrator to occasionally purge, backup or otherwise maintain the database created by the server.

\subsubsection{System and Software Quality}

\textit{Freedom in the Star System} should be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reliable
		\subitem The game should always produce the same outcomes given the same input and environment.
	\item Maintainable
		\subitem The source code should be easy to make changes to when needed.
	\item Portable
		\subitem The game should strive to remain available on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.  This should include making sure that third party tools being used are also portable.
	\item Testable
		\subitem The game logic should be easily testable using unit tests.
		\subitem The GUI should be easily testable using a manual test battery.
		\subitem The AI logic should be easily testable using either unit tests, or barring that, a manual test battery.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Packaging and Delivery Requirements}
%{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
%This paragraph shall specify the requirements, if any, for packaging,
%labeling, handling and delivery of the system being developed to the
%customer.}

The executable system and all associated documentation (i.e., SSRS, SSDD, Test Plan and Metrics Document and source code listing) will be available for the customer to acquire from the \textit{Freedom in the Star System} repository online at \url{https://github.com/ui-cs383/Freedom-Galaxy}.  Some associated documentation (i.e., SSRS, SSDD and Test Plan and Metrics Document) will also be delivered to the customer in hard copy.  Both of these deliverables will delivered, as specified by the customer, at the time of delivery.  Although document drops may occur throughout the system development process, the final, edited version of the above documents will accompany the final, accepted version of the executable system.

\subsubsection{Personnel-Related Requirements}
The system under development has no special personnel-related
characteristics.

\subsubsection{Training-related requirements}

No training materials or expectations are tied to this project other
than the limited help screens built into the software and the
accompanying user manual.

\subsubsection{Logistics-Related Requirements}
\textit{Freedom in the Star System} is supported under the following environments:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Operating Systems
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Linux 2.6 and above
		\item Mac OSX 10.7 and above
		\item Microsoft Windows XP and above
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Python 2.7.5
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item PyGame
		\item RPyC
		\item SQLAlchemy
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Broadband connection for Internet games
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Other Requirements}
There are no additional requirements for the \textit{Freedom in the Star System} application that have not been explicitly stated in this document.

\subsubsection{Precedence and Criticality of Requirements}
%{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
%This paragraph shall specify, if applicable, the order of precedence,
%criticality, or assigned weights indicating the relative importance of
%the requirements in this specification. \ Examples include identifying
%those requirements deemed critical to safety, to security, or to
%privacy for purposes of singling them out for special treatment. \ If
%all requirements have equal weight, this paragraph shall so state. }

The only requirements that carry any greater weight as compared to the other requirements are the system and logistic requirements.  It is critical to the successful execution of \textit{Freedom in the Star System} to run \textit{Freedom in the Star System} on a supported operating system and for the requisite dependent libraries to be correctly installed.

\section{Specific Requirements}
This section of the document will contain all of the software requirements in a sufficient level of detail to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.
%{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
%This section of the document should contain all of the software
%requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to
%design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that
%the system satisfies those requirements. \ Throughout this section,
%every stated requirement should be externally perceivable by users,
%operators, or other external systems. \ These requirements should
%include at a minimum a description of every input \ into the system,
%every output from the system, and all functions performed by the system
%in response to an input or in support of an output. \ As this is often
%the largest and most important part of the document, all requirements
%should be uniquely identifiable and careful attention should be given
%to organizing the requirements to maximize readability.}

\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
%{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
%This subsection should be a detailed description of all inputs into and
%outputs from the software system. \ It should complement the
%constraints and dependencies defined in earlier sections, but not
%repeat that information. \ Hardware, software, user, and other
%communication interfaces need to be specified. \ Use the four
%subsections listed below or the table on the next page, or some
%combination of both.}

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
No subsystem of \textit{Freedom in the Star System} relies on a hardware interface in order to operate.  The underlying operating systems controls any hardware that \textit{Freedom in the Star System} may depend on.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
Some of the Python libraries that \textit{Freedom in the Star System} relies on will use different software (i.e., some of the Python Libraries will communicate with the operating system), \textit{Freedom in the Star System} itself has no software interfaces except to Python itself.

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
The user interfaces can be separated by each subsystem.  The AI subsystem is the simplest - it has no user interface because it is executed by the Backend whenever it is needed.  The AI subsystem may produce a log file of actions occurred, but nothing else.  The Backend subsystem has a console based interface but the user cannot interact with it except to read the current status of the server and to terminate a currently running instance of the server.  The Client (GUI) subsystem however has a myriad of different user interfaces because that is what it has been designed for.  

The GUI will present two primary screens: an introduction screen, where the user will be able to create or join a match and the in-game screen which will contain all of the currently known information - information that the user is allowed to have knowledge of.  This information may include the status and quantity of one or both player's assets, the static objects of the game and information received about the current game state from the Backend.

The GUI will allow the user to send requests to change the game state to the Backend; the user may do this by using the ``drag and drop'' technique or by using keyboard and mouse hotkeys.  There are no plans currently to allow the GUI to function using only a keyboard, but using only a mouse will certainly be possible.

\subsubsection{Other Communication Interfaces}
The GUI and AI subsystems do not ever communicate with each other, but do in fact have to both communicate bi-directionally with the Backend subsystem.  In order to facilitate this, a network connection between the Backend and any client (human or AI) must be established.  \textit{Freedom in the Star System} uses RPyC in order to allow this.  The Backend and the Client may be on separate computers connected over the Internet, separate computers connected to an internal network or even running on the same computer using the loopback interface (commonly referred to as ``localhost'').  The AI subsystem, which is executed at the server's command still requires a network connection to be active and open for the duration of the game (it will likely run on the same machine as the server is running and will connect through localhost).

\subsection{System Features}
%{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
%Functional requirements should define the fundamental actions (i.e.,
%features) \ that must take place in the software in accepting and
%processing the inputs and in processing and generating the outputs.
%These requirements are given in the form of \textbf{Use Cases} where
%possible, denoting a concrete use (discrete user-performable task) of
%the system. Use case diagrams are followed by use case descriptions,
%followed by any non-task features. Non-task features are generally
%listed as {\textquotedblleft}shall{\textquotedblright} statements
%starting with {\textquotedblleft}The system
%shall{\dots}{\textquotedblright} \ These include: a) Validity checks on
%the inputs; b) Exact sequence of operations; c) Responses to abnormal
%situations, including error detection, handling and recovery; d)
%Parameter specification and usage; e) Relationship of outputs to
%inputs, including formulas for input to output conversion. \newline
%\newline
%It may be appropriate to partition the functional requirements into sub
%functions or subprocesses, but that decomposition (here) does not imply
%that the software design will also be partitioned that way. \ You
%should repeat subsections 3.2.i for every specified feature defined for
%the system or software.}
