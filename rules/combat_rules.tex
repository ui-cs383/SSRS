\subsection{Environ Combat}

Environ combat is one round and no wounds are applied to any unit. Damage either results in a unit being killed or no effect on the party.

\subsection{Character Combat}

Squad combat is performed according to the rules of character combat. Squad combat occurs if all military units of one side are eliminated and characters remain, or if military units successfully search for characters.

Character combat also occurs during missions due to irate locals or creature attacks.
